This repository contains all my scripts, Docker Compose and other useful files.

Feel free to use them if you need one of them for your personnal use.
Some Compose files are from conainers I don't use anymore and have not been updated since, you may need to change the version number in the file.

DISCLAIMER: These are made all by myself and for my own use, so they may not work for you without modifying them and, sometimes, they may have been poorly written 'cause I just don't care (The good old "If it works, don't touch it" rule).
