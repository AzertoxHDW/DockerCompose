This repository contains all my Docker Compose YAML files.

Feel free to use them if you need one of them for your personnal use.
Some of them are from conainers I don't use anymore and have not been updated since, you may need to change the version number in the file.

DISCLAIMER: These are made all by myself and for my own use, so they may not work for you without modifying them and, sometimes, they may have been poorly written 'cause I just don't care (The good old "If it works, don't touch it" rule).
